	<p style="text-align:center;">A collection of my tech projects.</p>

<h2>Air Alert</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;">Air Alert is my pride and joy right now. This project was a result of my friend Parker's dad dying from carbon monoxide emitted by his car, and we decided to do something about it. This device's patent is currently pending, and as a result, I can't include super duper detailed stuff here, but I can include a few pictures. Product is still very WIP and won't be finished for a while.</p>

<h2>RFID Attendance</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;">My band director got tired of taking attendance, and so I set out to build a system that would take attendance automatically as students "buzz in" to their class. Code is all on <a href="https://github.com/CWright2022" style="color:red">my GitHub</a> currently only a basic sketch to run on an ESP8266. Still needs lots of work on backend.</p>

<h2>The Arcades</h2>
	<p style="text-alight:left,">This was a fun one. My dad kept seeing these MAME machines running on a Raspberry Pi on reddit's /r/cade, and we set out to build not one, not 2, not 3, but 4, with one more still half-done. These machines are running 7,000+ old arcade games from dozens of systems, including the legendary NES, regular old arcade ROMS, Sega Genesis, SNES, Atari 2600 and 7800, and more. Also features 80s' background music on the menus to really take you back in time. Like I said, there's 4 of these currently "in the wild." My dad and his 2 other brothers each have a custom one, and I made one for my school's STEM lab. Each arcade has a Raspberry Pi 3, with a 32GB card, with a basic RetroPie image, that I packed to the brim with games, music, and scraped images and descriptions. I custom-designed some graphics for the sides, marqee, and control deck, they were printed by a local print shop on sticker paper, and used some cheap Chinese buttons and USB adapters. If you want me to send you the .img of the SD card for you to modify and use for yourself, contact me (cwright2022@gmail.com) and I'd be happy to send it over.</p>
