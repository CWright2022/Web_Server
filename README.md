# Web_Server
Code from my little Raspberry Pi web server, nothing too crazy. Some bits redacted for personal info.
Site is currently hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3, from my home internet, available at caydenwright.duckdns.org.
Site had HTTPS provided by a certificate from LetsEncrypt at one point, but I was tinkering and broke it, and haven't fixed it yet. Will be added at some point.
Next steps: learn some PHP so i can do cool stuff
